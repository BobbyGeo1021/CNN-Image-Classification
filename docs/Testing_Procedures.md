# Testing Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the testing procedures implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of the CNN model.

## Testing Steps
1. **Unit Tests**: A suite of unit tests is implemented using the unittest framework. These tests cover:
   - Model output shape
   - Model compilation
   - Layer configurations
2. **Validation Testing**: After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set to measure accuracy and loss.

## Conclusion
Testing is critical to validate the model's performance and ensure that the implementation is functioning as intended.
